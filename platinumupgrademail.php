            <h3>Notifications:</h3>

            <h4>Service Providers:</h4>
            <p>It is the responsibility of the Service Provider to maintain accountability of all scheduled appointments. We use multiple channels to notify Service Providers about each appointment. These channels are:</p>

            <h4>Calendar Invitation</h4>
            <p>If the Service Provider has shared their Google Calendar with us, they will be included on the same event invitation as the customer (decision maker).</p>

            <h4>Email Notification</h4>
            <p>All Service Providers are emailed with the full details of an appointment as soon as they are booked for it.</p>

            <h4>Phone Call</h4>
            <p>If an appointment is 2 days from scheduling or less, the Service Provider assigned will receive a phone call notifying them of the scheduling. Failure to return a missed call does not prevent appointment scheduling.</p>

            <h4>Customers:</h4>
            <p>All customers (Appointments) are notified through multiple channels about their upcoming bids.</p>

            <h4>Calendar Invitation</h4>

            <h4>Email with Service Provider's QM Profile</h4>

            <h4>Phone call at least 24 hours in advance to verify interest and attendance.</h4>

            <h4>NOTE:</h4>
            <p>No contact between the Service Provider and the business, or person, they are scheduled with prior to the appointment.<span class="text-danger"> ANY CONTACT PRIOR TO THE APPOINTMENT WILL DISQUALIFY THE SERVICE PROVIDER FROM RECEIVING A CREDIT.</span></p>
